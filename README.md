README.md

This is a test/learning project.

Everything here is subject to change at any time. You'll probably won't learn anything by reading this project, but I'm learning a lot experimenting with it. :)

Things outside my comfort zone so far that went well:
- Using Ubuntu instead of Windows for developing a .Net appplication;
- Using vs code instead of vs studio;
- Using git through command line instead of TFS and SVN;
- Using git on github instead of visualstudio.com;
- Deploying through 'dotnet' cli;
- Deploy sample application to Azure using github;


Things in line to be tested:
- Deploy sample application to Azure, using Azure cli;
- Create docker container with deployed application;
- Upload docker container configured to dockerhub;
- Deploy docker image to Azure;
